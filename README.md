I completed this project as the second installment of the One Month (onemonth.com) jQuery course. 
This project taught me the basics of using animation, and simple interaction methods by way of jQuery.


# Project 2: FAQ Page

Basic FAQ Page, using an animated accordion drop down. When a question is clicked, the corresponding answer is revealed.

## Links

jQuery: http://jquery.com/

The DOM:

## Challenge
* Create a custom animation using `animate()`
* Add a 4th question to the FAQ
* Replace the text of one of the answers with an image or gif
